## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis  that help investors to get an idea of a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa
and support the program. I was able to convert the data in the "tripduration" to DateTime datatype  using pandas PD data frame and I was able to create visualizations using Tableau shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week  and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

## Summary
This Analysis shows the high activity of the bike-sharing service in New York The far majority of the rides were in the very busy Manhattan Island,5 minutes is the most common Time for users to utilize bike-sharing,  this implies that the clients rely on this service for a short distance and Male users  make the majority of trip duration compared to Female,

For future Analysis 
We can compare trip duration to Age to determine which age make the majority of the trip and also for changing the style of the bikes based on the clients 
Another analysis will be comparing the weather to the trip duration based on that we can make an offer when the weather is good.
We can also create earning points for each client giving feedback about the bike how comfortable was the bike and would you take another trip using the bike . ? why? 
in order to compare the positive and negative feedback to trip duration, this analysis can change the profit of the company completely by better understanding the clients.
